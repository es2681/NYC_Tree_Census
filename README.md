# NYC Tree Census

## Overview
Between 2015 and 2016, the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation (DPR) conducted their third street tree census under the TreesCount! program, the largest municipal urban forestry project in US history. Over 2,200 volunteers as well as professional surveyors mapped 666,134 street trees on 131,488 blocks, walking a total of 11,093 miles. Previous surveys were conducted in 1995 and 2005. For further information, see the [TreesCount!](https://www.nycgovparks.org/trees/treescount) website.

The purpose of this evaluation was to identify the total number of live trees in each borough, as well as the prevalence of tree species, and to determine the number of trees per 1,000 people in each zip code. The data was analyzed using Python and a Jupyter Notebook.
